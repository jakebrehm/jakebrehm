<hr />

I'm a data engineer in the healthcare industry with 6 years of software engineering experience 👨🏻‍💻. I have a master's in data science, but I started my career automating physical testing in the aerospace industry. I love making lives easier, and I prioritize working on personal projects that teach me something new.

- 🚙 My daily drivers are Python and SQL, but I dabble in JavaScript and Swift.
- 📘 Expanding cloud knowledge while entertaining my app development curiosity.
- 🏥 Currently working at [Horizon Health Services](https://horizon-health.org/) (see [@jbrehmhhs](https://github.com/jbrehmhhs)).
